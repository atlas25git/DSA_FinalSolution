LDE is a polynomial eqn usually in 2 or more unknowns, with constraint that
only integral solutions exist to the unknowns

Q: determine if the eqn is LDE
    Ax + By = C
    
    g = GCD(a,b)
    then AB could be written as:
    A = K1*g
    B = K2*g

substituting in the eqn:
    K1*gX + K2*gY = c

    -> K1X + K2Y =c/g
    since lhs are integers, c/g should also be an integer
    implying that c is multiple of g => c%g =0;
    =>c/g = K

    K1X + K2Y = K

    current eqn is of the ExtendedEuclidean form:
    aX0 + bY0 = K*GCD(a,b);

    X1 = KX0
    Y1 = Ky0
    these are our first set of equations.

    There exists infinitely many soutions to the set of eqns:

    Family of solutions:

    X = X1 + (b/g)*t
    Y = Y1 + (a/g)*t

    t is a integral parameter.
