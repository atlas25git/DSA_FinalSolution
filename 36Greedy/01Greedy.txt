All the options considered -> DP, Brute Force
Best one selected -> Greedy
Choosing local minima at each step leads us to global minima, as int  the case of coin change problem.
Doesn't give accurate answer always.
Greedy based problem's solution's credibility is questionable.
As in: 15, [1,7,10] -> {5x1,1x10} = 6 coins (Not an optimal solution).
