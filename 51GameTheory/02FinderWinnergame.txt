Given n coins and 2 players A and B, A with moves a=2 & b=6,
A starts the game for 74 coins give the no. such that A should win.

No matter which move we at since the range of moves is min 2 max 6,
A will reduce the no of coins to ther earest multiple of 8, and since 8>max move
at the last level A would pick all the coins and win.

Why 8-> (a+b); moves
If we could reduce N to the nearest multiple of A+B, A wins-> else B does.
as in the case of 7.
//update
Read it as in adjunction of the previous finderWinner case, as there we divised the winning strategy
here we buil up on that so that in any case player has some coins remaining.
