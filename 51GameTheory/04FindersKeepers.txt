N=56, A,B a=1,b=6
As here we need to make the last person not be able to pick up all the coins,
and that's possible only when we reduce it to a ,multiple a+b this way it can't be
chosen without leaving  a few by the player in question

Here therefore for 56, whatever A chooses it can't reduce 56 to a multiple of (a+b)
therefore B will win by choosing 7-(vallue chosen by A) to maintain the schism.
