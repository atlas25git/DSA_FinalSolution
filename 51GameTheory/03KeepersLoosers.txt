Given some no N, A and B [3,5] : B starts the game
Person to pickk the last coin loses

For B to win he'll reduce the given no, to (a+b)K+[1,a]
//1 to a coz below the lb player has to pick yup all the coins

So the first player needs to make the no to the nearest multiple of (a+b)+[1,a]
So here the problem could be solved as:
94-> 88+[1,3]-> could be reduced to 91
92-> poss
76-> 72+[1,3]-> yes
66-> 64+[1,3]-> since the diff is lower than<3 we'll have to pick atleast 3 coins hence not possible
