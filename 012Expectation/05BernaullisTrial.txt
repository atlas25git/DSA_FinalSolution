Bernaulli trials

Such experiment which has exactly 2 outcomes, one of which is desired.

1) Coin Fkip
2) Success/failure

Theorem 1:
If prob of success of a bernaulli trial is p then the expected no of trials to get success is 1/p.

Theorem 2:
If prob of getting success in Bernaulli trial is p then expected no of successes in n trials is np.

Q-> N students asked to choose a no. from 1 to 100, expected no of students who would choose a single digit no:

Success = 9/100
E[success] = n.9/100
