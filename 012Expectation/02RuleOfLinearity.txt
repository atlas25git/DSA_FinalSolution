E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[y], regardless of X and Y's dependence or independence.
E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[y]
For the case of 2 dices thrown siimultaneously:

    For 2 dices = 3.5 + 3.5

2. Case of dependent cases:
Sum of nums rolled on a dice is A, product is b

E[A+B] = E[A] + E[B]
        (3.5 + 3.5) + (3.5*3.5)
