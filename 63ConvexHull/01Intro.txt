Intuition
----------
1) Analogy of a rubber band bound arounf protruding nails.
2) Convex hull is that set of points circumfacing as rubber band.
3) Convex hull will always form convex polygons.

Graham Scan Algorithm
---------------------
1) Sort co ordinates on the basis of x, if equal then y.
2) Therefore first and last points would be leftmost and rightmost respectively.
3) Join the points p[0],p[n-1] we'll get 2 sets of points on the sides of the line we just drew.
4) 
           \
         B .\____ angle=X               
            /
        A ./____ anfgle=Y

5) Based on X and Y now the next move of hull will be decided: 
    X<Y : counter clock wise-left
    X>Y : clok wise-right 
6) Slope could be calculated using 2 point formula.
    ax*(bc-cy) + bx(cy-ay) + cx(ay-by) ? 0
                                        < - ccw/left
                                        > - cw/rightmost
                                        = - collinear  

Discerning Set based on Orientation:
------------------------------------
1) For give 3 points p1,p[i],p2 :
                                    cw  -> upper half
                                    ccw -> lower half

Case: Collinear points also given:
----------------------------------
1) Final Covex Hull = (lowerHalf U upperHalf)
2) sort(points)
3) Get the unique set of it.
