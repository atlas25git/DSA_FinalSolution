Game of NIM:
----------------

Given a number of piles in which each pile contains some numbers of
stones/coins. In each turn, a player can choose only one pile and
remove any number of stones (at least one) from that pile. The player
who cannot move is considered to lose the game (i.e., one who take the
last stone is the winner).
FM A|B
Balanced state -> B winner
Unbalanced-> A winner

NIM sum -> cor of all the no. in set of states ->0 balanced else Unbalanced;
Winning state XOR!=0;


For the cases involving more than 2 piles -> Balanced State is checked
by computing their bitwise XOR==0 ->balanced FM loses.


Complex/Composite games-> could be divided into simpler games
Sprague Grundy Theorem:
--------------------------------

Grundy No -> size of piles
Mex: Minimum non neg element not present in a set.

Grundy No
G(s) = mex(G(s1),G(s2),....G(si)) ->{s1,s2,s3...si}-> states reachable directly from S
Basically mex here gives us the lower states to which our game could lead into

G(0)=mex(phi)=0
G(1)=0;
G(2)=mex(G(0),G(1))=>mex(0,1)=>2;

And atlast calculate xor of all the G nos calculated.

s = {s1,s2,s3...si}

XOR = G(s1)^G(s2)....^G(si)

Question:
============

Pile of 10 coins,a=1 b=3

for the given condition states reachable are calculated on the value of a and B
10{1,3} -> {9,8,7}
