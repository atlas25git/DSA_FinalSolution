Combinatorial Game Theory:

Consider a simple game which two players can play. There are N coins
in a pile. In each turn, a player can choose to remove one or two coins.
The players keep alternating turns and whoever removes the last coin
from the table wins.

Players play optimally to maximize heir chances of wining

1. Given 2 players and n coins, A starts the game there are 2 moves: 1c or 2c,
the last one to pick wins.
Solution given by: 
if(n%3==0)B wins
wlaw A wins

Approach: Reduce the game to the nearest multiple of (A+B)
